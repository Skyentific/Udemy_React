# Starting configuration for ES6/babel/webpack configuration using VScode and Chrome debugger.


When first cloned:
* run 
> npm install

To run the webpack dev server
* run
> npm run start

In Vscode, run the debugger.  Breakpoints don't work on intial launch, but will work once the debugger or the borwser is refreshed.

Base configuration from https://dev.itiden.se/debug-javascript-with-vs-code/
